## **9. Week 9: Databases III - NoSQL**

- **Topics:**

  2. Configuring NoSQL databases
  3. Performing CRUD operations
  4. Bonus: Firebase integration
  5. Quiz
  6. Homework
### **Task 9:  Databases III - NoSQL**
### **Homework Assignment**
1. Load **1000 objects** into the application from a **CSV file** generated using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/).
2. Create a method that **saves all elements** to a local database.
3. Implement an **aspect** that listens to the method execution:
  - At the start of the operation, it should trigger a **time counter**.
  - Once the operation is completed, it should log the **execution time**.
4. Do the same for **reading data** from the database (**without displaying** it, as this could distort the results).
5. Perform this experiment using **both a relational (SQL) and a non-relational (NoSQL) database**.
6. **Compare the results** and document your findings.
7. **Share your observations** with the group to discuss performance differences and insights.

### **Performance Comparison**
After executing the test:
- MongoDB was **approximately 35-36% faster** than MySQL in write and read operations.
- The additional overhead in MySQL comes from **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**, which introduces **extra processing time**.
- - Below is a **graphical representation** of the performance comparison:

### **Homework Assignment**
# API Integration Testing and Application Expansion

## ‚úÖ Integration Tests
Write **integration tests** to verify the correctness of the API developed in the past weeks. Ensure that all **GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE** methods work as intended, and that all exception handling cases are properly tested.  
üîπ **Remember to use profiles!** üòä

---

## üöÄ Application Expansion
### If your application stores **vehicles**, then:
- Create a **service method** that:
  - Retrieves all vehicles of a specified color from the database.
  - Changes (repaints) their color to a randomly chosen one.
- Write an appropriate **unit test** for this method.

### If your application stores a **different type of entity (other than a vehicle)**:
- Implement similar logic:
  - Fetch elements from the database based on a given parameter.
  - Randomly assign them a new value.

---

## üìù Testing Guidelines
üîπ **Unit tests** are sufficient to validate this functionality.  
üîπ If you want to expose this functionality via the **API**, then **integration tests or E2E tests** will be required. üöÄ
